{"name":"MCLauncher-API","tagline":"Documenting how minecraft launcher works & creating an API which will be able to work with custom launchers.","body":"### What is MCLauncher-API?\r\nMCLauncher-API is a work-in-progress API for creating Minecraft launchers with ease. MCLauncher-API will take care of backend stuff like listing versions, downloading game, resources, libraries neccessary for minecraft, so your only job will be to create the GUI for the launcher. Basically, it's an SDK/API/framework for minecraft launchers.\r\n\r\n### What languages is it available in?\r\n* Java - official repo (maintained by @Tomsik68)\r\n* C# - https://github.com/mathwhiz19/mclauncher-api (maintained by @mathwhiz19)\r\nYou can feel free to fork the repo and add your own code in other languages and the repos will appear here :)\r\n\r\n### How do I rewrite the API to other language?\r\nYou obviously need to know the language before rewriting the API ;) \r\nFor more information, look at the documentation here: https://github.com/tomsik68/mclauncher-api/wiki#documentation\r\n\r\nWhen rewriting the API to other language, you should also write an API guide, so users know how to work with the API.\r\n\r\n### How do I work with the API?\r\nThe official repo contains API Guides on wiki here ---> https://github.com/tomsik68/mclauncher-api/wiki/API-Guide\r\n\r\n### What's the latest version?\r\nCurrently, there's no versioning except the github one, so just see the latest commit :)\r\nI'm also working on RSS thread for versions & updates, but that'll be available later.\r\n\r\n### More about author\r\n@Tomsik68 is junior java coder, who has been creating bukkit plugins for some time. He became interested in minecraft launchers by decompiling the official one. At the moment, he's working on a page for one of his minecraft-related projects.\r\n\r\nIf you want to message the author, you can do so on twitter - https://twitter.com/tomsik68\r\n\r\n### License\r\nThis project is currently under CC-BY-NC-SA license 3.0 http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/3.0/deed.en_US","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
